    One day, a donkey and a tiger had an argument. 
      The donkey said, "The grass is blue The tiger replied, "No, the grass is green They held their own opinions and refused to compromise, and the argument became increasingly heated. 
      Finally, the two decided to submit this issue to Judge Lion.
       They approached the lion and the donkey shouted loudly, "Your Honor, isn't the grass blue The lion replied, "If you really think so, grass is blue The donkey persisted and said, 
       "The tiger disagrees with this and speaks disrespectfully. 
       Please punish him 
       The lion then announced, "The tiger will be punished with three days of reflection on the wall The donkey was very happy and left contentedly, muttering incessantly, "The grass is blue, the grass is blue 
       The tiger was very angry and said, "Your Honor, isn't the grass green The lion replied, 
       "The grass is indeed green The tiger was puzzled and asked, "Why did you punish me The lion replied, "Punishing you has nothing to do with the question of whether the grass is blue or green, but rather because advanced creatures like you waste time arguing with donkeys about such simple questions. 
       Most importantly, you're still bothering me with this question just to verify that you already know it's true 
       This fable comes to an end, it actually talks about how to handle disputes. Its viewpoint is simple, just don't argue. 
       Firstly, some people are simply unable to persuade, as they do not care about the truth or reality, but only focus on their beliefs and viewpoints to achieve victory. 
       They will do their best to defend themselves as right, arguing with such people is a waste of time. Secondly, once an argument begins, emotions inevitably overwhelm reason. When your determination to win or lose is high and you are determined to defeat the opponent, your intelligence will sharply decline.
